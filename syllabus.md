# DSC 180A Syllabus

## Description

DSC 180A covers two parallel topics:
1. The basics of “data science methodology” for a large project,
   including best practices for data handling and project
   reproducibility.
2. Beginning research into your choice of domain. Acquaintance with a
   domain is made via replicating a specified result on a curated
   dataset in ~6 possible areas (e.g. genetics, cognitive science,
   computer vision, oceanography, political science, sociology,
   industry analytics, and art).
   

The replication of the domain result in (2) will use the best
practices learned in (1). This work then serves as a foundation for
project proposals due at the end of the quarter. The projects will be
worked on, in groups, in DSC 180B. While the methodology portion is
taught in a traditional lecture setting, most of the material covered
in this course will be done through reading, data exploration, and
ensuing discussion.

## Course Components

### Lecture (data science methodology)
One hour per week will be devoted to lecture on data science
methodology. There will be accompanying light homework assignments.

### Discussion (domain)

Two hours per week will be devoted to discussion about domain specific
topics, as such you must attend the section for your choice of
domain. Discussion will involve discussion about reading and
assignments, so it is imperative that you complete the relevant
assignments before attending discussion section. Each section begins
with a set of questions to which you will write a response; your
response will serve to stimulate class discussion.

###  Remark on how the course is split
As is common in Data Science, you will likely find yourself as a
bridge between domain specialists and (computing) methodology
specialists. In the case of this course, it is expected and normal
that discussion section leaders will not know specifics of your code
(or even know the language you are coding in!). You will have both (1)
office hours with a methodology expert and (2) office hours and
discussion with domain experts. As such, it is up to you to formulate
your questions for the appropriate audience (domain expert or
computing expert), so that you can adequately communicate with them to
solve the problem you are facing.

## Course Deliverables

###  Methodology HW
Weekly HW on the lecture component of the course is meant to reinforce
lecture topics enough to enable you to apply the topics to the
domain-specific project. **This HW is worked on individually**.

### Replication of a result in chosen domain
These assignments serve the dual purpose of introducing you to your
domain of choice, as well as helping you learn the mechanics of
putting together a project in your specific domain. Your output will
serve “starter code” for your own project work in Q2.

* Literature review (written report)
* Exploratory data analysis into dataset (written report)
* Result replication (written report)
* Data acquisition + cleaning (code)
* Full project pipeline (code)

**This HW is worked on individually**

### Project proposal

The final course deliverable is a project proposal for the second
quarter project. **This proposal (along with the project itself) will be
worked on in small groups.**

* Written proposal (with background research)
* Skeleton project workflow / github repository / page.
* Elevator pitch (video on Piazza)

**This proposal (along with the project itself) will be
worked on in small groups.**

## Assessments and Grades

The course grade will be computed using the following proportions:

|Component|% of Grade|
|---|---|
|Methodology HW|10%|
|Discussion Section Participation|10%|
|Domain result replication (3 reports)|30%|
|Domain result replication (workflow)|20%|
|Project proposal|30%|

## Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity

In DSC 180, we expect you to work hard and engage with material that
originates outside the academic walls. All ideas and work must be your
own, that of your approved group, or properly cited. Act with
integrity and don't cheat.

### Why is academic integrity important?

Academic integrity is an issue that should be important to all students on campus. When students act unethically by copying someone’s work, taking an exam for someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades and for the University to give degrees that reflect student knowledge. This devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it important for the entire campus to band together and enforce that all members of this community are honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD!

The [Jacobs School of Engineering Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmaeweb.ucsd.edu%2Fundergrad%2Fcourses%2Fintegrity&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGlz4x5OEvugccWorxKhK4-fpoE8w), the [UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Facademicintegrity.ucsd.edu%2Fprocess%2Fpolicy.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE3SXZNVviORdYbRcypRot-WcJk0g) and this syllabus list some of the standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations.

### What counts as cheating?

In DSC 180A you are encouraged to use outside resources to help with
your work. However, **you must properly cite any concepts, writing, or
code** that originates from other sources. If you are unsure of
whether something needs a citation, it's best to:
* consult the domain expert for your section, and
* follow the examples in course readings.
* place code citations with the relevant link in comments.

The following activities are considered cheating and ARE NOT ALLOWED
in DSC 180 (this is not an exhaustive list):

* Using or submitting either writing or code acquired from other
  students (except your partner, where allowed).
* Not properly citing ideas, writing, or code acquired from outside
  sources. (Citations are a good thing!)
* Having any other student complete any part of an assignment on your
  behalf.
* Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else.

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and
ARE ALLOWED in DSC 180:

* Discussing the general approach to understanding or solving a problem.
* Talking about debugging/cleaning strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them.
* Using outside material with proper citations (including
StackOverflow code!).

Remember, Academic Integrity is about doing your part to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility and Courage. 

## Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.). Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive. 

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course. If there is a way we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door. Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and input. 

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the [UCSD Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html). Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels comfortable.If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, please contact the [Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/).
